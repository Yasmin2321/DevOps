# DevOps
What is DevOps? (add diagram)
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

Benefits of DevOps? Benefits for businesses?
Faster time to market: DevOps enables faster delivery of software features and updates, which can give organizations a competitive edge in their market.
Improved collaboration: DevOps fosters greater collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other teams, which leads to better outcomes and a more positive work culture.
Increased efficiency and productivity: DevOps can help organizations streamline their processes and automate repetitive tasks, leading to greater efficiency and productivity.


What does the role entail?
On a day-to-day basis, DevOps professionals are responsible for maintaining and improving the software delivery pipeline, ensuring that code is delivered smoothly from development to production environments. They work closely with developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders to:
Develop and maintain automation scripts,Monitor and troubleshoot systems and Deploy and configure infrastructure.



Who do DevOps Engineers work with?
DevOps engineers play a key role in promoting collaboration and communication between different teams and stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of delivering high-quality software efficiently and effectively.They mainly work with developers ,It operators,QA engineers,security professionals and business stakeholders.

What other teams does a DevOps Engineer interact with?
Infrastructure teams: DevOps engineers work closely with infrastructure teams to design and implement the underlying infrastructure that supports software development and delivery.
Release management teams: DevOps engineers collaborate with release management teams to plan and coordinate software releases across different environments.
Security teams: DevOps engineers work with security teams to ensure that software and infrastructure are secure and compliant with industry regulations.


What are their common deliverables (what would they be expected to do on day to day basis)?


What is the value of a DevOps Engineer?
DevOps engineers bring quite extensive value to business these include :

Improving software delivery: They help organizations to deliver software more quickly, reliably, and efficiently, which can improve customer satisfaction and give the organization a competitive edge.

Promoting collaboration: They foster greater collaboration and communication between different teams, which can lead to better outcomes and a more positive work culture.

Increasing efficiency: They automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, which can save time and reduce costs.

Enhancing quality: They implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, which enable organizations to catch and fix bugs more quickly and to deploy new features more reliably.


How do DevOps Engineers fit into the SDLC?
Planning:
Collaborate with developers and stakeholders to align software development with business goals
Identify requirements and plan for infrastructure needs
Development:
Work with developers to integrate code and ensure smooth deployments across different environments
Automate testing and quality assurance processes
Testing:
Automate testing to catch and fix bugs more quickly
Work with QA teams to ensure that test environments are properly configured and maintained
Deployment:
Automate deployment processes to ensure quick, reliable deployments with minimal downtime
Ensure that infrastructure is properly configured and maintained to support the application
Operations:
Work with operations teams to monitor and troubleshoot issues that arise with the software or infrastructure
Implement security measures to ensure that software and infrastructure are secure and compliant with industry regulations
Overall, DevOps Engineers play a crucial role in promoting collaboration, communication, and automation across the SDLC to ensure the efficient delivery of high-quality software.

What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more. Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, users can access and use these resources as needed, paying only for what they use. Cloud computing offers a flexible and scalable solution for businesses of all sizes, allowing them to quickly and easily access the computing power they need without having to invest in costly hardware and maintenance.


Who is using DevOps? – Case studies (2-4 total, simple overview of how they use it, no need for depth).

Amazon has adopted a DevOps culture and practices across its development and operations teams.
Amazon has adopted a microservices architecture, which allows for greater flexibility and scalability. This approach involves breaking down monolithic applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed more quickly and with greater reliability.
Continuous Improvement: Amazon is constantly looking for ways to improve its development and delivery processes, using metrics and feedback to identify areas for improvement.
Amazon emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams. This includes regular communication and problem-solving to improve processes and solve issues.
Amazon heavily relies on automation to ensure that code is released quickly and reliably. This includes automated testing, deployment, and monitoring tools.
